Hi, I'm Rojina Gurung, a second-year BIT student with a passion for both frontend and backend development. I want to expand my knowledge in web development. I am introverted at times but I also enjoy traveling and making new friends too. 
iam completely beginner right now.
 I strive to grow both professionally and personally in the tech world so, i thought it would be beneficial session for me.
